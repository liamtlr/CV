_Everyone asks about the GitHub username, so I thought I would explain it here. It's German for 'We are Pope' (I speak German and used to live in Austria), which was a  fantastic/ridiculous headline in a lowbrow German tabloid when a German pope was consecrated, see [this](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=wirsind+papst+bild&espv=2&biw=1231&bih=633&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-pMqjnYDRAhVCshQKHcktB_0Q_AUIBigB&dpr=2#imgrc=VCYdUJ3YpSRwiM%3A) or the [wikipedia article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wir_sind_Papst!)._

_It's just something irreverent, given I am blessed/cursed with an extremely common name._

Having recently exited management consulting before being promoted past a point of no return, I'm keen to find a junior developer role. To help make this happen, I've just completed the 3 month MakersAcademy coding bootcamp. This has given me the skills to produce test-driven full-stack web applications, driven by my own learning, using a variety of programming languages and supporting technologies.

## I built these: ##

| Language / Framework | Related project | Supporting technologies |
|---|---|---|
|JavaScript / Meteor | [I'm In: a volunteering platform](https://github.com/wirsindpapst/project-snowflake) | Chimp, Mocha/Chai, Google Maps API
| Pure JavaScript (no framework) | [A news summary app](https://github.com/wirsindpapst/news-app-js) | Jasmine |
| Ruby / Rails | [MakersBnB: an AirBnB clone app](https://github.com/wirsindpapst/makersbnb) | Rspec/Capybara, PostgreSQL/ActiveRecord |
| Python / Django | [Unchained: A blogging platform](https://github.com/wirsindpapst/unchained_blog) | Unittest / Selenium WebDriver, Facebook Developer API

# Aside from coding ... #

## ... I combine analytical and creative thinking ##

 -  I have a degree in German and Russian from Cambridge University. A big part of this was writing essays answering questions on the literature, history and philosophy of these cultures, and then defending my viewpoint in discussions with leading academics in these fields.
 -  I have produced a number of business cases to provide the rationale for strategic investment at a number of clients, in one example securing a £30m funding allocation. Beyond just crunching the numbers, I then had to distil data into a set of digestible findings and compelling recommendations to enable informed executive level decision making.
 - As an English Language Teaching Assistant, I was responsible for coming up with conversation-driven lessons for a range of age groups and abilities. I often drew upon the strong cultural heritage of my North Eastern roots (think lessons on Geordie Shore tenuously disguised as a debate on youth drinking culture) to pique the interests of some of Vienna's moodiest adolescents.

## ... I like to get things done ##

-  In my previous career I have worked on projects in a number of different client-facing roles, including but not limited to: project manager, business analyst, business case lead, IT sourcing lead. Basically, I've been trusted as a safe pair of hands with a lot of difficult jobs.
 -  I love creating clean, test-driven code, but understand this is ultimately to provide functionality and value to the end user. I see code as a means to an end and not an art form unto itself.

## ... I deal well with change and uncertainty ##

 -  As a consultant I was placed in client-facing roles at short notice, often with little clarity as to the role I was taking on. I've had to quickly become an effective consultant in the areas of IT sourcing, IT strategy, IT Service Management and IT programme assurance (excuse the jargon) with little or no previous experience.
 -  As part of the MakersAcademy bootcamp I have familiarised myself with an entirely new language / framework and produced a working web application in 5 days.
 -  As part of the year abroad element of my degree, a planned internship at a Russian human rights organisation was made impossible when my visa application was rejected. As a result I had to make replacement plans in extremely short notice. I found replacement work, accommodation and travel arrangements in Kyiv, Ukraine in under 10 days.
