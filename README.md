_Everyone asks about the GitHub username, so I thought I would explain it here. It's German for 'We are Pope' (I speak German and used to live in Austria), which was a  fantastic/ridiculous headline in a lowbrow German tabloid when a German pope was consecrated, see [this](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=wirsind+papst+bild&espv=2&biw=1231&bih=633&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi-pMqjnYDRAhVCshQKHcktB_0Q_AUIBigB&dpr=2#imgrc=VCYdUJ3YpSRwiM%3A) or the [wikipedia article](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wir_sind_Papst!)._

_It's just something irreverent, given I am blessed/cursed with an extremely common name._

Having recently exited management consulting before being promoted past a point of no return, I'm keen to find a junior developer role. To help make this happen, I've just completed the 3 month MakersAcademy coding bootcamp. This has given me the skills needed to produce test-driven full-stack web applications, driven by my own learning, using a variety of programming languages and supporting technologies.

## I built these: ##

| Language / Framework | Related project | Supporting technologies |
|---|---|---|
|JavaScript / Meteor | [I'm In: a volunteering platform](https://github.com/wirsindpapst/project-snowflake) | Chimp, Mocha/Chai, Google Maps API
| Pure JavaScript (no framework) | [A news summary app](https://github.com/wirsindpapst/news-app-js) | Jasmine |
| Ruby / Rails | MakersBnB: an AirBnB clone app | Rspec/Capybara, PostgreSQL/ActiveRecord |
| Python / Django | Unchained:A blogging platform | Unittest / Selenium WebDriver, Facebook Developer API
