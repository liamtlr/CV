Management consultant turned full-stack developer. Having been a Jack-of-all-trades all my life, I'm most comfortable developing features end to end. I'm looking for a new role to continue to challenge me in different ways. I try to be a good person that people like to have around.

## Current stack

* VueJS/VueX/Stylus
* PostgreSQL
* Django/Django Rest Framework
* Docker/Ansible
* AWS Lambda (and the rest of the usual stuff

## Jobs I've had ##

### [Piclo](http://piclo.energy)

November 2017 - present

Joined Piclo at a really good time. Spent the first 6 months maintaining gross, monolithic spaghetti code developed by other people, before we pivoted away to a new product. Took my battle scars from there to help build a new, microservice-led project from scratch.

Have maintained a pretty broad spectrum across the stack, as is necessary with a microservice architecture. Want to stay that way, ideally. Do need to frequently get help from a friendly DevOps colleague when I'm knee deep in Ansible though.

P.S. Not totally sold on/wedded to microservices.

### [CUBED Attribution](http://cubed.ai)

March - October 2017

These guys were total cowboys.. but they gave me my first dev role so I guess I'm grateful.

Mainly worked in the front end on data visualisation of customer interaction with clients' brands via advertising and other media interaction.

## Aside from coding ... ##

### ... I combine analytical and creative thinking ###

 -  I have produced a number of business cases to provide the rationale for strategic investment, such as the initial business case for [Frontline](http://www.thefrontline.org.uk/), which was used in discussions with the Secretary of State for Education for government funding. Beyond just crunching the numbers, I had to distil data into a set of digestible findings and compelling recommendations to enable decision making.
 -  I have a degree in German and Russian from Cambridge University. A big part of this was writing essays answering questions on the literature, history and philosophy of these cultures, and then defending my viewpoint in discussions with leading academics in these fields.
 - As an English Language Teaching Assistant, I was responsible for coming up with conversation-driven lessons for a range of age groups and abilities. I often drew upon the strong cultural heritage of my North Eastern roots (think lessons on Geordie Shore tenuously disguised as a debate on youth drinking culture) to pique the interests of some of Vienna's moodiest adolescents.

### ... I like to get things done ###

-  In my previous career I have worked on projects in a number of different client-facing roles, including but not limited to: project manager, business analyst, business case lead, IT sourcing lead. Basically, I've been trusted as a safe pair of hands with a lot of difficult jobs.
-  I love creating clean, test-driven code, but understand this is ultimately to provide functionality and value to the end user.

### ... I deal well with change and uncertainty ###

 -  As a consultant I was placed in client-facing roles at short notice, often with little clarity as to the role I was taking on. I've had to quickly become an effective consultant in the areas of IT sourcing, IT strategy, IT Service Management and IT programme assurance (excuse the jargon) with little or no previous experience.
 -  As part of the MakersAcademy bootcamp I have familiarised myself with new languages / frameworks and produced web applications in 5 days.
 -  As part of the year abroad element of my degree, a planned internship at a Russian human rights organisation was made impossible when my visa application was rejected. As a result I had to make replacement plans in extremely short notice. I found replacement work, accommodation and travel arrangements in Kyiv, Ukraine in under 10 days.

## Miscellany

 -  Not particularly out there; I love to read (talk to me about Guenter Grass, Elfriede Jelinek, Margaret Atwood and China Mieville). I also go to a book group for Dystopian and Post-Apocalyptic fiction (a guilty pleasure).
 -  Board games (co operative, strategic or something with a good gimmick is right up my street).
